<br/><b>File::rewrite</b><hr />
File::rewrite(name, mode = &quot;&quot;) {|| ...}<br />
<p />
From /home/trans/Documents/programs/current/facets/doc/ri/File/cdesc-File.yaml<hr />
Opens a file as a string and writes back the string to the file at the end of the block.<p />
Returns the number of written bytes or <tt>nil</tt> if the file wasn't modified.<p />
Note that the file will even be written back in case the block raises an exception.<p />
Mode can either be &quot;b&quot; or &quot;+&quot; and specifies to open the file in binary mode (no mapping of the plattform's newlines to &quot;\n&quot; is done) or to append to it.<p />
<pre>  # Reverse contents of &amp;quot;message&amp;quot;
  File.rewrite(&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;) { |str| str.reverse }

  # Replace &amp;quot;foo&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;binary&amp;quot;
  File.rewrite(&amp;quot;binary&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;) { |str| str.gsub(&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;) }
</pre>
IMPORTANT: The old version of this method required in place modification of the file string. The new version will write whatever the block returns instead!!!<p />
