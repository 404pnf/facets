Facets 2.5.0 is an significant milestone in the development of
Facets. 

First, this release has been tested against Rails' ActiveSupport
library. As long as Facets is loaded after ActiveSupport, everthing
should work fine. Of course, there's no counting for real world
trials, but all ActiveSupport tests cases passed under this scenario.

Secondly, Facets 2.5.0 is nearly Ruby 1.9 ready. While it has not
been turoughly tested yet, the extensions have been reviewed for
potential conflicts and made conditional on the running version
of Ruby where they overlap.

Lastly, this release is the first of a set of down-scaling releases
that will remove any remaining library "fat" from the collection.
Some libraries have been spun-off into separate projects.

  If you were using...   Use this project instead...

    annotations.rb         Anise

    bytes.rb               RichUnits
    multiplers.rb
    times.rb

A few other libraries have also been depreacted but lack any
dedicated, compatible replacement. This was done in cases where
the codebase was weak and other libraries exist that provide
better solutions.

  If you were using...   Recommend switching to...

    command.rb             Clio -or- OptParse
    buildable.rb           Nokogiri -or- Markaby

Although this release constitutes a slimming down of Facets, one
library in particular has been added to Facets: *ini.rb* by
Jeena Paradies. While YAML is frequently used by Rubyists for
configuration files, a full-on serializer like YAML is often
overkill. INI files provide a lightweight solution specifically
geared for configuration files.
