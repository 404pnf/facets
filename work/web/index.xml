    <td><p>The philosophy of <span class="red">Facets</span> can be summed
    up in a simple mantra, "ALL BASE COMMON". The idea being, that by sharing a broad foundation
    in common, that foundation can better serve the Ruby community. There are a number of
    advantages to this approach. Among them: name consistency, better code-reuse, collaborative
    improvements and reduced installation requirements.</p></td>

    <td><p>At the heart of Facets is a collection of core extension
    methods. All of which can be loaded with the single call: <code class="red">require 'facets'</code>.
    There are hundreds of quality methods in this collection which have been derived
    from years of experience of dozens of top Ruby programmers.</p></td>

    <td><p>In addition to the core libraries, Facets provides dozens of additional
    classes, modules, mixins and light-weight frameworks. These solid libraries provide
    a general-purpose set of components commonly useful across a variety of applications.</p></td>

    <td><p>Facets is not the sole achievement of one person, but was made possible by the hard
    work of many excellent programmers. Some persons contributed code directly, other's simply
    had their code picked-up from another open resource. In either case, three cheeers
    for all!</p>
