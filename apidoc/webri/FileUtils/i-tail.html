<br/><b>FileUtils#tail</b><hr />
tail(filename,lines=10)<br />
<p />
From /home/trans/Documents/programs/current/facets/doc/ri/FileUtils/cdesc-FileUtils.yaml<hr />
In block form, yields the last number of ((<b>lines</b>)) of file ((<b>filename</b>)). In non-block form, it returns the lines as an array.<p />
Note that this method slurps the entire file, so I don't recommend it for very large files. If you want an advanced form of ((<b>tail</b>)), I suggest using file-tail, by Florian Frank (available on the RAA). And no tail -f.<p />
<pre>  # Returns last 3 lines of 'myfile'
  FileUtils.tail(&amp;quot;myfile&amp;quot;,3)
</pre>
