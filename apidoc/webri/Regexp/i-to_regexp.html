to_regexp()<br />
<p />
From /home/trans/Documents/programs/current/facets/doc/ri/Regexp/cdesc-Regexp.yaml<hr />
Like #to_re, but following Ruby's formal definitions, only a Regular expression type object will respond to this.<p />
Note that to be of much real use this should be defined in core Ruby.<p />
