<h1>Random</h1>
Randomization core extension methods.<p />
This library extends Array, String and Hash with randomization methods. Most of the methods are of one of two kinds. Either they &quot;pick&quot; a random element from the reciever or they randomly &quot;shuffle&quot; the reciever.<p />
The most common example is Array#shuffle, which simply randmomizes the order of an array's elements.<p />
<pre>  [1,2,3].shuffle  #=&amp;gt; [2,3,1]
</pre>
The other methods do similar things for their respective classes.<p />
