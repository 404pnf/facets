      Ruby Facets is the single largest collection of core extension methods
      and standard library additions available for the Ruby programming language.

        <h3>The <b>IDEA</b></h3>

        <p>As programmers are wont to do, I started collecting reusable pieces of
        Ruby long ago. At first it was just a small function here, a useful
        module there. Eventually the collection became sizable and I called it <i>TomsLib</i>.
        As time wore on and my library grew, I started to feel it worth a general
        release. Sometime shortly there after I hit upon the idea of <i>atomicity</i>
        for the core extensions. That's how the name Facets came about -- it's all about
        the little things. Much has changed since those first days. But time has been
        good to Facets. Today, Facets 2.0 is a more solid and leaner library than ever before.</p>

        <p>The continuing philosophy of <span class="red">Facets</span> can be summed
        up in a simple mantra, "ALL BASE COMMON". The notion is that by sharing
        a large common foundation, that foundation can better serve us.
        There are a number of advantages to this approach. Among them
        name consistency, better code-reuse, collaborative improvements and
        reduced installation requirements.</p>

        <h3>The <b>CORE</b></h3>

        <p><span style="font-size:.7em;">Hundreds of methods in the Atomic Methods collection!</span></p>

        <p><span class="red">Facets/<b>CORE</b></span> is a vast collection of core extension methods,
        plus a few basic classes. All of which can be loaded with the one command <code>require 'facets'</code>.
        But... of particular uniqueness is the library's atomicity. CORE is an
        <span class="red"><i>Atomic Library</i></span> becuase all methods are organized into
        small, tightly bound groups, such that each group can be required independently of any other
        This allows for highly granular control over loaded features, which can be useful to minimize
        resource footprint and potential "cross-talk" with other code resources.
        </p>

        <p><i>The concept of atomicity has changed from series 1.x to 2.x. Previously, every
        single method was isolated from all others. While this made organization of the code quite nice,
        in practice it proved too granular --subatomic, if you will. With 2.0 we have created more
        sensible "atoms" of closely related functionality. Facets remains very granular however. Very few
        libraryfiles contain more than a handfule of methods. We also note, that since this is a new
        organization, which adds an additional layer of categorization, there are still refinements
        being made.</i></p>

        <h3>And <b>MORE</b></h3>

        <p><span style="font-size:.7em;">Dozens of classes, modules and micro frameworks.</span></p>

        <p><span class="red">Facets/<b>MORE</b></span> is a collection of classes, modules and
        micro-frameworks which constitute an ever improving source of general-purpose, reusable components.
        Some very nice additions are available, from an elegant Annotations systems to the more typical
        classes, such as Tuple and Dictionary.</p>

        <p><i>Facets 2.x is a much leaner library than the 1.x series. Where 1.x still focused on
        gathering large swaths of new functionally, 2.x is focusing on refinement. Along with this
        came a new "definition" of what it is to be "MORE". MORE is the equivalent of Ruby's Standard
        library. As such, only libraries one might reasonably conceive as part of Ruby's Standard lib
        are included. This led to a number of libraries being moved to their own projects.
        In particular, the web-related libraries were moved to <a href="http://blow.rubyforge.org">Blow</a>,
        the Units system to <a href="http://stick.rubyforge.org">Stick</a>, and the inflection system to
        <a href="http://english.rubyforge.org">English</a>. There were also a few libs removed simply
        because they weren't stable and/or useful enough.</i></p>
