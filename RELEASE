Facets 2.5.2 fixes a few bugs, makes some small but nice additions
and improves 1.9 compatibility.

The most important addition to make note of is Object#extend, which has
been overridden to allow a block parameter. This is one of only two or three
actual "monkey patches" in all of Facets. The block, when provided,
is used to create an annonymous module which then extends the reciever.
This is a "good practice" way to extend objects, rather than using class_eval
on the singleton class.

Special thanks to Erik Veenstra, Pit Capitan and especially Sandor Sz√ºcs
for their contributions to this release.

Enjoy!
