<p>
As a REMINDER, Facets 2.4+ now encourages:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets'
</pre>
<p>
This is better than cherry-picking methods. It may seem counter-intuitive,
but it actually proves more advantages to do this for the sake of improved
interoperability. The practice of cherry-picking can become problematic if
other dependent libraries have cherry-picked different methods. In those
cases these distinctions go unaccounted and untested.
</p>
<p>
Facets is almost fully interoperable with ActiveSupport and Ruby 1.9. We
will continue to improve this interoperability in upcoming releases.
