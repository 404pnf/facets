Facets 2.5.0 is an significant milestone in the development of
Facets.

First, this release has been tested against Rails' ActiveSupport
library. As long as Facets is loaded after ActiveSupport, everything
should work fine. Of course, there's no counting for real world
trials, but all ActiveSupport tests cases pass under this scenario.

Secondly, Facets 2.5.0 is nearly Ruby 1.9 ready. While it has not
been thoroughly tested yet, the extensions have been reviewed for
potential conflicts and made conditional on the running version
of Ruby where they overlap. So it's a good start. Over the next
couple of release we will complete this process.

Lastly, and most importantly, this release is a significant down 
scaling that removes much of the libraries remaining "fat". Some
scriptss have been spun-off into separate, largely compatible
projects.

  If you were using...   Use this project instead...

    annotations.rb         Anise

    bytes.rb               RichUnits
    multiplers.rb
    times.rb

    ziputils.rb            Folio
    uploadutils.rb

    command.rb             Clio
    consoleutils.rb

While a few others have been deprecated because they were simply 
experimental, such as chain.rb and eventhook.rb.

Although this release largely constitutes a slimming down of Facets,
two excellent new libraries have been added.

1) *ini.rb* by Jeena Paradies. While YAML is frequently used by
Rubyists for configuration files, a full-on serializer like YAML
is often overkill. INI files provide a lightweight solution
specifically geared for configuration files.

2) *filter.rb* by Brian Candler offers lazy evaluation chains of 
Enumerable methods. This is an elegant way to optimize contiguous
maps, selections, etc. --effective even on infinite enumerators.

While work remains to be done, I am happy to say, Facets is 
finally reaching the level of solidity I set out to achieve just
over a year ago. Whew!

Special thanks to Brian Candler, Jeena Paradies and Tyler Rick.

Enjoy!


### 2.5.0 / 2008-11-23

* 9 Major Changes

    * Added Brian Candler's Enumerator::Filter
    * added sparse_array.rb (was old harray.rb)
    * added Jeena Paradies' ini.rb
    * renamed CacheDelegator to Memoizer
    * renamed DictionaryMatcher to just Matcher
    * deprecated bytes.rb and times.rb (use RichUnits instead)
    * deprecated uploadutils.rb; ziputils.rb will be (use Folio)
    * deprecated annotations.rb (use Anise instead)
    * deprecated command.rb and consoleutils.rb (use Clio instead)

* 5 Minor Changes

    * deprecated chain.rb (very expiremental)
    * deprecated eventhook.rb (moved to ToadCode project)
    * deprecated tagiter.rb (moved to ToadCode project)
    * moved Hash#symolize_keys and #stringify_keys to core lib
      (still recommend #rekey instead though)
    * switched to git as of 2.4.5

* 4 Bug Fixes

    * memoize.rb, cache was at class-level, now at instance-level
    * binding/caller.rb, fixed require for callstack.rb
    * fixed missing require in string/tabto.rb
    * Fixed some bugs with Time#ago/Time#hence not changing years
      correctly when you changed months.
      (For example, Time.utc(2008, 1, 1).ago(12, :months) incorrectly
      returned 2009-01-01 instead of 2007-01-01.)
      Changed Time#ago/Time#hence to still work if passed negative number.
