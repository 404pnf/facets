Normally when including modules, class/module methods are not extended. To achieve this behavior requires some clever Ruby Karate. Instead class_extension provides an easy to use and clean solution. Simply place the extending class methods in a block of the special module method #class_extension.<p />
<pre>  module Mix
    def inst_meth
      puts 'inst_meth'
    end

    class_extend do
      def class_meth
        &amp;quot;Class Method!&amp;quot;
      end
    end
  end

  class X
    include Mix
  end

  X.class_meth  #=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Class Method!&amp;quot;
</pre>
NOTE: This old #class_extension version of this method did not extend the containing class automatically --it had to be done by hand. With #class_extend, that is no longer the case.<p />
