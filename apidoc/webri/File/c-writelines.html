File::writelines(path, data)<br />
<p />
From /home/trans/Documents/programs/current/facets/doc/ri/File/cdesc-File.yaml<hr />
Writes the given array of data to the given path and closes the file. This is done in binary mode, complementing <tt>IO.readlines</tt> in standard Ruby.<p />
Note that <tt>readlines</tt> (the standard Ruby method) returns an array of lines <i>with newlines intact</i>, whereas <tt>writelines</tt> uses <tt>puts</tt>, and so appends newlines if necessary. In this small way, <tt>readlines</tt> and <tt>writelines</tt> are not exact opposites.<p />
Returns <tt>nil</tt>.<p />
