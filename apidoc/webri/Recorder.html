<br/><b>Class: Recorder < Object</b><hr />
<h1>Recorder</h1>
Recorder is similar essentially a method probe. It records everthing that happens to it, building an internal parse tree. You can then pass a substitute object and apply the recoding to it. Or you can utilize the parse tree.<p />
The only limitation of Recorder is with special operators, like if, &amp;&amp;, ||, etc. Since they are not true methods they can't be recorded. (Too bad for Ruby.)<p />
<pre>  class Z
    def name ; 'George' ; end
    def age ; 12 ; end
  end

  z = Z.new

  r = Recorder.new
  q = proc { |x| (x.name == 'George') &amp;amp; (x.age &amp;gt; 10) }
  x = q[r]
  x.&lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt;(z)
