<h1>Ruby Facets</h1>

<p>“ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO RUBY”</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Ruby Facets is the premiere collection of general purpose method extensions
and standard additions for the Ruby programming language.</p>

<p>Facets houses the largest single collection of methods available for
extending the core capabilities of Ruby’s built-in classes and modules.
This collection of extension methods are unique by virtue of their
atomicity. The methods are stored in individual files so that each can be
required independently. This gives developers the potential for much finer
control over which extra methods to bring into their code.</p>

<p>In addition Facets provides a collection of extensions to Ruby standard
library plus a small collection of add-on classes and modules. Together
these libraries constitute an ever improving source of reusable components,
suitable to a wide variety of usecases.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Facets has special documentation needs due to it’s extensive bredth. The
RDocs generated when installing via RubyGems are unweildly because it
combines all of Facets in one set of docs. (Hopefully we can remedy this in
the future). In the mean time better organized online documentation  is
available at <a
href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/learn.html">rubyworks.github.com/facets/learn.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The easiest way to install is via RubyGems.</p>

<pre class="code">$ <span class='gem identifier id'>gem</span> <span class='install identifier id'>install</span> <span class='facets identifier id'>facets</span>
</pre>

<p>To install manually, your will need Ruby Setup (<a
href="http::/setup.rubyforge.org">:/setup.rubyforge.org</a>). Then download
and unpack the .tar.gz package and run:</p>

<pre class="code">$ <span class='tar identifier id'>tar</span> <span class='minus op'>-</span><span class='xvzf identifier id'>xvzf</span> <span class='facets identifier id'>facets</span><span class='minus op'>-</span><span class='float val'>2</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='x identifier id'>x</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='x identifier id'>x</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='tar identifier id'>tar</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='gz identifier id'>gz</span>
$ <span class='cd identifier id'>cd</span> <span class='facets identifier id'>facets</span><span class='minus op'>-</span><span class='float val'>2</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='x identifier id'>x</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='x identifier id'>x</span>
$ <span class='sudo identifier id'>sudo</span> <span class='setup identifier id'>setup</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='rb identifier id'>rb</span>
</pre>

<p>Facets 2.8+ requires Ruby 1.8.7 or higher.</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>Facets holds to the notion that the more we can reasonably integrate into a
common foundation, directed toward general needs, the better that
foundation will be able to serve the community. There are a number of
advantages here:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Better Code-reuse</p>
</li><li>
<p>Collaborative Improvements</p>
</li><li>
<p>Greater Name Consistency</p>
</li><li>
<p>One-stop Shop and Installation</p>
</li></ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>CORE Library</h3>

<p>At the heart of Ruby Facets is the CORE extensions library. CORE provides a
sizable collection of generally useful methods, along with a few supporting
classes, that extend the functionality of Ruby’s core classes and
modules.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few <b>uncommon</b> extensions, CORE contains
anything that will load automatically when issuing:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'facets'</span>
</pre>

<p>This loads all the CORE functionality at once. If you plan to use more then
a handful of Facets core methods it is recommended that you require the
library in this way.</p>

<p>Of course you can use the CORE library piecemeal if you prefer. And for
uncommon extension this must be done. The general require statement for a
core extensions library is:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'facets/&lt;class|module&gt;/&lt;method-lib&gt;'</span>
</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'facets/time/stamp'</span>
</pre>

<p>Most “atoms” contain only one method, but a few exceptions occur when
methods are closely tied together.</p>

<p>You can load per-class or per-module groups of core methods by requiring
the class or module by name. For example“</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'facets/time'</span>
</pre>

<p>Will require all the core Time method extensions.</p>

<p>Note that some methods that were part of CORE in 1.8 and earlier are now
part of MORE libraries. A good example is ‘random.rb’. There were
separated because they had more specialized use cases, where as CORE
extensions are intended as general purpose.</p>

<p>This is the recommended usage. However, you can also “cherry pick” core
methods. While there are exceptions the rule of thumb for loading a core
method is:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'facets/{class|module}/{method}'</span>
</pre>

<h4>Method File Names</h4>

<p>Operator method redirect files are stored using English names. For instance
for Proc#* is ‘proc/op_mul’.</p>

<p>For reference, here is the chart.</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='plus op'>+</span>@   <span class='assign token'>=</span><span class='gt op'>&gt;</span> <span class='op_plus identifier id'>op_plus</span>
<span class='minus op'>-</span>@   <span class='assign token'>=</span><span class='gt op'>&gt;</span> <span class='op_minus identifier id'>op_minus</span>
<span class='plus op'>+</span>    <span class='assign token'>=</span><span class='gt op'>&gt;</span> <span class='op_add identifier id'>op_add</span>
<span class='minus op'>-</span>    <span class='assign token'>=</span><span class='gt op'>&gt;</span> <span class='op_sub identifier id'>op_sub</span>
<span class='pow op'>**</span>   <span class='assign token'>=</span><span class='gt op'>&gt;</span> <span class='op_pow identifier id'>op_pow</span>
<span class='mult op'>*</span>    <span class='assign token'>=</span><span class='gt op'>&gt;</span> <span class='op_mul identifier id'>op_mul</span>
<span class='regexp val'>/    =&gt; op_div
%    =&gt; op_mod
~    =&gt; op_tilde
&lt;=&gt;  =&gt; op_cmp
&lt;&lt;   =&gt; op_lshift
&gt;&gt;   =&gt; op_rshift
&lt;    =&gt; op_lt
&gt;    =&gt; op_gt
===  =&gt; op_case
==   =&gt; op_equal
=~   =&gt; op_apply
&lt;=   =&gt; op_lt_eq
&gt;=   =&gt; op_gt_eq
|    =&gt; op_or
&amp;    =&gt; op_and
^    =&gt; op_xor
[]=  =&gt; op_store
[]   =&gt; op_fetch
</span></pre>

<p>Facets simply takes the ‘*’ and translates it into a string acceptable
to all file systems. Also, if a method ends in ‘=’, ‘?’ or ‘!’
it is simply removed.</p>

<h3>MORE Library</h3>

<p>On top of the extensive CORE library, Facets provides extensions for
Ruby’s standard library, as well as very small collection of additional
modules and classes to supplement it.</p>

<p>Use the More library like you would any other 3rd party library. The only
difference between Facets More library and other libraries is the lack of
any enclosing @Facets::@ namespace. This is becuase the libraries provided
by Facets are considerd fairly low-level.</p>

<p>When using Facets’ extended versions of Ruby’s standard libraries, the
More libraries have to loaded manually, of course. However you do not need
to load Ruby’s library first, as the Facets’ library will do that
automatically.</p>

<p>For example, normally one load Ruby’s OpenStruct class via:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'ostruct'</span>
</pre>

<p>To load ‘ostruct.rb’ plus Facets extensions for it simply use:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'facets/ostruct'</span>
</pre>

<p>instead.</p>

<p>Using the Facets/MORE library of modules, classes or microframeworks is
essentially the same. For example:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'facets/basicobject'</span>
</pre>

<p>Again, for details pertaining to the functionality of each feature, please
see the API Docs.</p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>

<p>This project thrives on contribution.</p>

<p>If you have any extension methods, classes, modules or small frameworks

included in this project, don’t hesitiate to submit. Also, if you have
better versions of any thing already included or simply have a patch, they
are more than welcome. We want Ruby Facets to be of the highest quality.</p>
