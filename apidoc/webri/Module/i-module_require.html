Require file into module/class namespace.<p />
Unlike load this keeps a per-module cache and will not load the same file into the same module more than once despite repeated attempts.<p />
The cache is kept in a global var called +$module_require+.<p />
Please use this with careful consideration. It is best suited to loading plugin-type scripts, and should generally not be used as a substitue for Ruby's standard load system.<p />
