== 2.4.2 / 2008-08-12

    * See 2.4.3. This was just a test release that was available for only one day.


== 2.4.1 / 2008-04-03

* 5 Changes

    * Comparing to ActiveSupport, found 63 extension clashes, but most are due to 1.9 features and the rest should be compatible.
    * A much improved paramix.rb has been returned to the library; but please note it's not quite finished yet.
    * Reatomized a number of Kernel and String methods. Reatomization is nearly complete.
    * Deprecated behavior.rb. It was not robust.
    * Added basex.rb, library for working in any encoding base using any character set (base62 is the default).


== 2.4.0 / 2008-03-24

* 

    * String#to_re and String#to_rx have swapped default behaviors. #to_rx escapes, #to_re does not.
    * The Console namespace is being deprecated. command.rb and arguments.rb now use CLI naemspace.
    * #compare_on and #equate_on are now "mixin methods" Comparable() and Equateable().
    * Enumerable#product, #combintations and #permutations have change to be Ruby 1.9 compatible.
    * thread.rb, map_send, et al, block is passed to send instead of yielding on result.
    * namespace.rb has been renamed to methodspace.rb.
    * Ruby 1.9 defined a new Proc#curry method, so Facets version has been made compatible.
    * The old curry method is now called #partial, as in "partial application".
    * Deprecated interface.rb. Perhaps a better approach but nonetheless extraneous.
    * Deprecated paramix.rb. A better way is to use a capitialized methods. (Perhaps a lib for that?)
    * Brought back a few web related libs, htmlfilter.rb and cssfilter.rb in particular.
    * camelcase and snakecase are core extensions. For specialized styles use String#style in style.rb.
    * This was a fairly large and fast-paced update, so unfortunately not all changes are listed this time.


== 2.3.0 / 2008-02-01

    * Reorganized library into smaller groups: core, more, class and mixin.
    * Added tracepoint.rb back to the library.
    * Fixed multiglob_r bug, so it will NOT follow symlinks.


== 2.2.1 / 2007-12-22

    * Got rid of methods subdir. All method redirects are in core/.


== 2.2.0 / 2007-12-13

    * A lot of rdoc updates to core extensions --as promised ;)
    * Just about every method now has at least a brief explinaiton and an example.
    * integer/bitmask.rb has changed a bit --pun intended ;) Deprecated some methods and now use "~" instead of "-" to clear bits.
    * The name Array#unzip didn't makes sense, it was renamed to #modulate (though #collate seems better?)
    * Renamed Enumerable#collate to #mash (Map hASH); #collate and #graph remain aliases for the time being.
    * Deprecated Module#include_and_extend. Just use both silly.
    * More lib pp_s.rb has been removed. Use #pretty_inspect instead.
    * Split binding extensions up a bit more finely --eval.rb sprouted here.rb, self.rb and defined.rb.
    * Move Time#stamp out of conversion.rb and into time/ dir, and remove to_s alias.
    * Preliminary addition of Matthew Harris' excellent duration.rb lib (will integrate with times.rb better in future).
    * Added if clauses to handle upcoming Ruby 1.9 gracefully. Facets should now be just about ready for use with 1.9.


== 2.1.3 / 2007-11-28

    * Fixed minor oddity in Enumerable/collate.
    * Fixed major issue with 2.1.2 where it would not core facets correctly.


== 2.1.2 / 2007-11-22

    * Dir::multiglob no longer handels -/+ modifiers. Use FileList instead.

    * All attr_xxx methods have coresponding alias_xxx methods.
    * Fixed bug in Enumerable#cluster_by which returned nil instead of [].

    * Added final methods Gavin Sinclair's Extensions project (contributed by Noah Gibbs).
    * Fixes bug with Dictionary#initialize
    * Fixes bug with Hash#-
    * Also improves changelog production.
    * Made #alias_method_chain compatible with current ActiveSupport version.
