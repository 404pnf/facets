<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>RubyGems</h2>

<p>Facets can be dowloaded and installed easily using RubyGems:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install facets
</code></pre>

<p>Gems will automatically generate rdocs on installation. Unfortunately
the Gem generated rdocs are very poor --in fact Facets only allows them
to be generated to ensure the creation of ri docs (ruby api index files).
We recommend instead that you use the pre-generated rdocs on the website.</p>

<h2>Site Install</h2>

<p>If you would like to install from source, you can download the tarball
package from <a href="http://github.com/rubyworks/facets/download">GitHub</a>
and use <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/setup">Ruby Setup</a>, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>$ tar -xvzf facets-2.9.0.tgz
$ cd facets-2.9.0
$ setup.rb
</code></pre>

<p>The last step may require super-user permissions (eg. use <code>sudo</code>).</p>

<p>Of course, to use Facets you also need <em>Ruby</em>. The 2.x versions of Facets are
designed to work with Ruby 1.8.6 and up. Facets is fully compatible with Ruby 1.9.</p>

<h1>API Documentation</h1>

<p>Facets API is divided into two documentation sets, one for each library group,
CORE for the core extensions and MORE for standard extensions and additions.</p>

<h2>Core API</h2>

<p>The <a href="doc/api/core/index.html">CORE API</a> includes all
the "prime" extensions. These methods are at the heart of Facets. Any
application or library that makes use of Facets, you can be sure, supports
these methods. Also include is the Functor class, which is a Higher Order
Message class. It is used by a number of methods to provide fluid interfaces.</p>

<h2>More API</h2>

<p>The <a href="doc/api/standard/index.html">MORE API</a> documents the
variety of extension methods to Ruby's standard library, and additional
classes, modules and micro-frameworks Facets provides as optional libraries.</p>

<h1>Wiki</h1>

<p>The Wiki is a place for end-users to create their own documentation. Ultimately,
it is hoped, this documentaiton will make a great source for sharing real-world
use cases. However, a full Wiki solution isn't in place yetand we are simply
using Google Pages, provided along side the Google mailing list interface.</p>

<p>Facets has a community wiki that anyone can use to help document Facets at
<a href="http://wiki.github.com/rubyworks/facets">Facets Wiki</a>.</p>

<h1>Mailing List</h1>

<p>Facets has a dedicated mailing list hosted via
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/facets-universal/topics">Google Groups</a>.
The same list is used by developers and end-users alike. If you have a
question or a suggestion the list is a good place to get feedback about it.</p>
