<br/><b>Class: Capsule < Module</b><hr />
<h1>Capsule</h1>
A Capsule is subclass of Module. It encapsulates an extenal script as a funcitons module.<p />
A module which is an instance of the Capsule class encapsulates in its scope the top-level methods, top-level constants, and instance variables defined in a ruby script file (and its subfiles) loaded by a ruby program. This allows use of script files to define objects that can be loaded into a program in much the same way that objects can be loaded from YAML or Marshal files.<p />
See intro.txt[link:files/intro_txt.html] for an overview.<p />
