cattr( *syms )<br />

From /home/trans/Documents/programs/current/facets/doc/ri/Class/cdesc-Class.yaml<hr />
Creates a class-variable attribute that can be accessed both on an instance and class level.<p />
NOTE This used to be a Module method. But turns out it does not work as expected when included. The class-level method is not carried along. So it is now just a Class method. Accordingly, #mattr has been deprecated.<p />
