__method__()<br />
<p />
From /home/trans/Documents/programs/current/facets/doc/ri/Binding/cdesc-Binding.yaml<hr />
There is a lot of debate on what to call this. <tt>method_name</tt> differs from #called only by the fact that it returns a string, rather then a symbol.<p />
<pre>  def tester; p methodname; end
  tester  #=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;tester&amp;quot;
</pre>
