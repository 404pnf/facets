rewrite(rules)<br />
<p />
From /home/trans/Documents/programs/current/facets/doc/ri/String/cdesc-String.yaml<hr />
Apply a set of rules (regular expression matches) to the string.<p />
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
The rules must be applied in order! So we cannot use a hash because the ordering is not guaranteed! we use an array instead.<p />
<h3>Input:</h3>
The array containing rule-pairs (match, write).<p />
<h3>Output:</h3>
The rewritten string.<p />
