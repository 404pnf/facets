From /home/trans/Documents/programs/current/facets/doc/ri/String/cdesc-String.yaml<hr />
Upcase first letter.<p />
NOTE: One might argue that this method should behave the same as <tt>#upcase</tt> and rather this behavior should be in place of <tt>#captialize</tt>. Probably so, but since Matz has already defined <tt>#captialize</tt> the way it is, this name seems most fitting to the missing behavior.<p />
