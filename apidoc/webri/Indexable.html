<br/><b>Class: Indexable</b><hr />
<h1>Indexable</h1>
Indexable is a mixin that provides index based methods, working soley with four methods: #index, #slice, #splice and #size.<p />
These methods work in harmony. Where #index returns a position of a given element, #slice returns elements for given positions. #splice is like #slice but replaces the given position with new values. This mehtod is not part of ruby core, but it generally just an alias for #[]=, just as #slice is an alias of #[]. #size of course simply returns the total length of the indexable object.<p />
