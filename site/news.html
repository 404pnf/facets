    <h2><a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/posts/2010-09-01-release-2-9.html">Facets 2.9 Release</a></h2>
    <h3>Sun Aug 29 13:29:42 -0400 2010</h3>
    <p>Facets 2.9 is fairly extensive as it was originally intended to be v3.0.
After further consideration it was decided to reserve v3.0 for something a
little bolder (to be announced). The primary goal of this release was to
trim Facets down to a true core extensions library. All tertiary add-on classes
and mixins have now been spun-off to other projects. Only a very select set of
general purposes classes and mixins remain.</p>

<p>A new <em>TOUR</em> library division has been added to complement <em>CORE</em> and <em>MORE</em>.
This division houses purely optional extensions. The new division serves
a couple of useful purposes. In particular, it helps separates the standard
library extensions from optional core extension in the RDocs and thus makes
the perfect place to vet new extension ideas.</p>

<p>One important change that will effect anyone using Facets along side
ActiveSupport is that Facets no longer tries to conditionally avoid
method overlaps with ActiveSupport. This is fine for the upcoming
ActiveSupport 3.0 library which extends core classes directly instead of
using mixins. One need only require 'facets' in Rails' config/preinitializer.rb
file, and ActiveSupport will take precedence over Facets. For older versions
of ActiveSupport, the best approach is to cherry pick from Facets just the
extensions you want, thus avoiding any conflicts. There are actually only a
dozen or so overlaps and all are intended to compatible, but it doesn't hurt
to be sure.</p>

<p>I won't detail each change here, have a look at the HISTORY.rdoc file for that.
Needless to say, it's a good idea to read it over to see what changes might
effect you usage --and it also gives you a glimpse at what other extensions are
available that you might not yet be familiar.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/posts/2009-11-09-release-2-8.html">Facets 2.8 Release</a></h2>
    <h3>Sun Aug 29 13:29:42 -0400 2010</h3>
    <p>Facets 2.8 effectively completes the MORE library clean-up which peaked
with the previous 2.7 release. In so doing, five additional libraries
have been deprecated:</p>

<ul>
<li>fileable.rb    (too esoteric)</li>
<li>ioredirect.rb  (needs better implementation)</li>
<li>coroutine.rb   (because of Fiber)</li>
<li>capsule.rb     (may be spun-off)</li>
<li>recorder.rb    (may be spun-off)</li>
</ul>


<p>Three other libraries have been deprecated, but have been spun-off
to the new 'ansi' project:</p>

<ul>
<li>ansicode.rb</li>
<li>progressbar.rb</li>
<li>logger.rb</li>
</ul>


<p>This version of Facets also reverts a few of the deprecations made before --
reconsiderations made due to analysis of the code as suitable for release
as separate projects. These libs will thus remain in Facets's MORE library
at least for the forseeable future.</p>

<ul>
<li>ini.rb</li>
<li>linkedlist.rb</li>
<li>matcher.rb</li>
<li>memoizer.rb</li>
<li>roman.rb</li>
<li>semaphore.rb</li>
</ul>


<p>Other minor enhancements have also been made in the release. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kernel#extend can now take a block</li>
<li>Fixed kernel#d so it is useable</li>
<li>Added method #at_rand to Range in random.rb (thanks to Tyler Rick).</li>
<li>Added method #map_detect to Enumerable (thanks to Scott Taylor).</li>
<li>Added method #/ to String, which calls File.join.</li>
<li>Added method #newlines and #cleanlines to String.</li>
<li>String#titlecase now handles apostrophes.</li>
<li>BasicObject/BlankSlate is more compliant with 1.9.1's design.</li>
<li>Enumerable#count can take multiple items, treats them as a logical Or.</li>
<li>Class#class_extend extends class level, rather than use class_eval.</li>
<li>Integer#succ(n) becomes Fixnum#succ(n) in succ.rb.</li>
<li>inheritor.rb has been rewritten.</li>
<li>The Shellwords extensions have been reworked.</li>
<li>Added #similarity method to String.</li>
<li>Added a Levenshtein edit_distance method to String.</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to all this, we have recently set up a new Ruby 1.9 compliance procedure
using RunCodeRun.com. Actually RunCodeRun helps us to ensure 1.8.6 compabiltiy as well.
This is great tool for improving code quality, and comes highly recommended.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/posts/2009-07-21-new-website.html">New Website with Jekyll</a></h2>
    <h3>Sun Aug 29 13:29:42 -0400 2010</h3>
    <p>The old Ruby Facets website was a static 100% XML/XSLT site. When I originally created
the site, I though XML/XSLT suredly was the pinnicale and proper way to build a
modern site --for no other reason that XSL is a pain in the ass! Well, we all know
the ultimate outcome of this story. XML/XSLT is turning out to be an exmplar of
over engineering by academics.</p>

<p>The new Facets website runs of Jekyll, a static site generator supoprted by GitHub.
(another good site tool is Shunman)</p>

    <h2><a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/posts/2008-03-24-release-2-4.html">Facets 2.4.3</a></h2>
    <h3>Sun Aug 29 13:29:42 -0400 2010</h3>
    <p>Facets 2.4.3 is now out in the wild. The release is primarily a maintenance
release &#8212;fixing a handful of small bugs and adding some small feature
improvements, but a few significant changes are also present.</p>

<ul>
<li>Moved Mentalguy's lazy.rb to CORE!</li>
<li>Moved Indexable and Stackable to core.</li>
<li>Added Time#trunc and Time#round to CORE.</li>
<li>Added Ken Bloom's DictionaryMatcher class (maybe renamed in future version)</li>
<li>Added Array#recursively and fixed bug in Hash#recursively.</li>
<li>Added kernel/instance method which provides a fluent interface to private object space.</li>
<li>Renamed Class#to_pathname and #to_methodname to #pathize and #methodize.</li>
<li>Changed File#rewrite to not use the in-place change of the string.</li>
<li>Changed Dictionary#first and #last to take optional arguments.</li>
<li>Deprecated Hash#keys_to_s and Hash#keys_to_sym (use #rekey).</li>
<li>Deprecated Console:: namespace for ANSICode.</li>
<li>Deprecated ruby.rb, which was a sort 1.9 compatibility layer.</li>
<li>The ruby.rb methods were moved to core, wrapped in a 1.9 condition.</li>
<li>Fixed Time#hence changed years when changing months.</li>
<li>Fixed Time#hence to flip year correctly when adding months.</li>
<li>Improved File#rootname, it is now more robust.</li>
<li>Made FileUtils#whereis a module_function again.</li>
<li>Use "lib/lore" to separate extensions to Ruby's standard library.</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that this release does not include a setup.rb script. We are working
on a new version of this script, which we plan to include in the next
release.</p>

<p>Special thanks to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ken Bloom</li>
<li>Nick Caruso</li>
<li>Evgeniy Dolzhenko</li>
<li>Andy Freeman</li>
<li>Tomasz Muras</li>
<li>Dave Myron</li>
</ul>


<p>And of course, to anyone else I failed to mention that has contributed.</p>

<p>Finally, Facets 2.4+ now encourages using:</p>

<pre><code>require 'facets'
</code></pre>

<p>when testing, even if you are cherry-picking methods. It may seem counter-intuitive,
but it actually proves more advantages to do this for the sake of improved
interoperability. The practice of cherry-picking can become problematic if
other dependent libraries have cherry-picked different methods, and the
the different choices go unaccounted and untested.</p>

<p>Facets is almost fully interoperable with ActiveSupport and Ruby 1.9. We
will continue to improve this interoperability in upcoming releases.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/posts/2008-01-01-how-facets-was-born.html">How Facets Was Born</a></h2>
    <h3>Sun Aug 29 13:29:42 -0400 2010</h3>
    <p>As programmers are wont to do, I started collecting reusable pieces of
Ruby long ago. At first it was just a small function here, a useful
module there. Eventually the collection became sizable and I called it <i>TomsLib</i>.
As time wore on and my library grew, I started to feel it worth a general
release and I had renamed it <i>Raspberry Lib</i>. But sometime shortly thereafter
I hit upon the idea of <i>atomicity</i> of the core extensions. And that's how the
name Facets came about --it's all about the little things. Of course, that name
took a while to decide upon too. The library was almost called "Atomix &amp; Trix"!</p>

<p>Facets has eveolved considerably over the years --and lessons were learned. Probably
the biggest lesson was the 2.0 release, where the idea of atomicity was eroded and
and alternate means of library requiring was attempted. Both were rectified by 2.4.</p>

<p>Much has changed since those first days. But time has been good to Facets.
Today, Facets is a more solid and leaner library than ever before and will
continue in the fashion for version to come.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/posts/2009-08-22-release-2-7.html">Facets 2.7 is a Significant Release</a></h2>
    <h3>Sun Aug 29 13:29:42 -0400 2010</h3>
    <p>Facets 2.7 is most significant release of Facets since 2.4. Rather then trickle-release
these changes over the course of the 2.6.x series, I made the decision to let 2.7 have them
all at once. In so doing this release nearly completes the process of trimming down
the MORE library to its essentials. Over 40 high-level libraries have been spun-off
as separate gems and/or deprecated. No doubt this is a big change for Facets, and the
transition may be a bit bumpy over the short-term, but I am certain that in the long-run
everyone involved will be better served. To help, I have listed the effected libraries
and the alternate gems available to take their place.</p>
